Spyre by David Wilson

I'd like to thank Github for messing up the code indentation ;(


Installation:

`cd /usr/local/share`
`git clone https://github.com/ForeverDev/spyre2 spyre`
`cd spyre`
`make`


To compile a .spy file:

`spy -c input_filename.spy -o compiled_filename.spyb`


To run a compiled file:

`spy -r compiled_filename.spyb`


To do it all in one step, then throw away the compiled file:

`spy input_filename.spy`
