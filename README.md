Spyre by David Wilson

I'd like to thank Github for messing up the code indentation ;(


Installation:

`git clone https://github.com/ForeverDev/spyre2 spyre`

`cd spyre`

`make`


To compile a .spy file:

`spy c (input_filename).spy (compiled_filename)`


To run a compiled file:

`spy r (compiled_filename)`
