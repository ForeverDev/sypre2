Spyre by David Wilson
I'd like to thank Github for messing up the code indentation ;(

Installation:
```git clone https://github.com/ForeverDev/spyre2 spyre
cd spyre
make```

To compile a .spy file:
`spy c (input_filename).spy (compiled_filename)`

To run a compiled file:
`spy r (compiled_filename)`
